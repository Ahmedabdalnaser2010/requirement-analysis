## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the requirement analysis documentation for a hotel booking management system similar to Airbnb or OYO. It includes functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. It involves:
- Gathering and documenting requirements
- Analyzing and prioritizing needs
- Validating requirements with stakeholders

In SDLC, it's the crucial first phase that bridges business needs with technical implementation.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Prevents Costly Changes**: Identifying requirements early reduces expensive changes later
2. **Sets Clear Expectations**: Aligns stakeholders and developers on system functionality
3. **Forms Development Foundation**: Provides blueprint for design, coding, and testing
