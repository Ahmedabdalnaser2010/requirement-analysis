## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the requirement analysis documentation for a hotel booking management system similar to Airbnb or OYO. It includes functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. It involves:
- Gathering and documenting requirements
- Analyzing and prioritizing needs
- Validating requirements with stakeholders

In SDLC, it's the crucial first phase that bridges business needs with technical implementation.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Prevents Costly Changes**: Identifying requirements early reduces expensive changes later
2. **Sets Clear Expectations**: Aligns stakeholders and developers on system functionality
3. **Forms Development Foundation**: Provides blueprint for design, coding, and testing

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collect needs through interviews, surveys (e.g., hotel managers need property management tools)
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Refine requirements via workshops and prototypes
- **Requirement Documentation**: Create SRS document with functional/non-functional requirements
- **Analysis & Modeling**: Develop use cases and data models (like hotel booking flow)
- **Requirement Validation**: Review requirements for completeness and consistency

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Property Search: Users can filter hotels by location, price, amenities
2. Booking System: Secure reservation process with payment integration
3. User Profiles: Registration/login with authentication

### Non-functional Requirements
1. Performance: Handle 1000 concurrent users with <2s response time
2. Security: Encrypt sensitive data like payment information
3. Scalability: Microservices architecture to handle peak loads

## Use Case Diagrams



Benefits:
- Visualizes system interactions
- Identifies all user roles and functions
- Guides development and testing
